Project Overview

This program is a generative art sketch written in Processing, featuring an abstract representation of a city skyline with a background gradient, text, and a custom tristar symbol. The visual composition combines color gradients, 2D shapes, and stylized objects, producing a vibrant and dynamic composition that can be used as an artistic welcome screen, for example, in a music city-themed project.

Features

Color Gradient Background: A smooth gradient transition between yellow and purple hues.
Skyline Drawing: Multiple skyline shapes are drawn with offsets for visual variety, allowing for layered cityscapes.
Text Rendering: Displays the phrase "Welcome to Music City!" in a custom font and color.
Tristar Symbol: A stylized tristar (three-star) shape is drawn with elliptical and polygonal forms in a dynamic position.
Customizable Parameters: Several parameters allow for easy adjustments, including the number of iterations for skyline drawing, horizontal and vertical offsets for positioning, and color choices.
